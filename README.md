# Critical point networks
## Description
This repository contains python scripts for some of the computation models explored in "The Cortex and the Critical Point: Understanding the Power of Emergence", by John M. Beggs. The models that are implemented here are:
- Cellular automata
- Wilson-Cowan model
- Branching model
- Layered branching model

Additionally there are some files containing results generated by the models, and Jupyter notebooks with the analysis performed on said results.

## Implementation
The scripts of each model need to be executed in the Processing environment (https://processing.org/), and the tunable parameters of each model can be modified in its `params.py` file.

## Results
As can be seen in the analysis notebooks, these models reproduce some of the results discussed in the source material. In particular, the fenomenon of neuronal networks as a system that presents phase transitions and a critical point is explored.
